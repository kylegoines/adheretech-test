# Adheretech

Hi there, welcome to Adheretech. We want to test your skills in CSS with a small layout example as well as a javascript based test.
Both of these have practical concepts that we make use of every day.

<br>

## Getting Started

After forking this project, in the root of the project, in terminal, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to get started, this will notify you of a local instance at `localhost:1234` to see any code output you have. 

For Reference: our watch task uses `parcel-bundler` for js and css compliation.

### JS test
Go to the `index.js` file for more information on the task. Feel free to use any es6+ feature to complete the test.

### CSS test

The CSS text will judge you knowledge of layouts and breakpoints. Feel free to use any CSS3+ technology you want. In the root of the folder we have supplied you with 2 design layouts: mobile and desktop. CSS updates will automatically refresh the page and add your style changes.

We've added some starter html in `index.html` to get you started.
_you don't need to be pixel perfect and height/widths can be eyeballed_
